# DRG_Research
## We use the following case sensitive targets and attributes in the provided order and the largest GloVe model trained on 800 billion tokens (glove.840B.300d), compute the WEAT effect-size and p-value both with the normal distribution generated by 1,000 iterations and the empirical distribution generated by 1,000,000 iterations.
### target2= man, father
### attribute1= health, happy
### attribute2= pollute, tragedy
## We use the following attributes and the largest GloVe model, compute the SC-WEAT (aka WEFAT) effect-size and p-value with an empirical distribution generated via 1,000,000 permutations for the case sensitive words “Xinyu”, "weat", "AylinCaliskan”.
### attribute1 = caress, freedom, health, love, peace, cheer, friend, heaven, loyal, pleasure, diamond, gentle, honest, lucky, rainbow, diploma, gift, honor, miracle, sunrise, family, happy, laughter, paradise, vacation
### attribute2 = abuse, crash, filth, murder, sickness, accident, death, grief, poison, stink, assault, disaster, hatred, pollute, tragedy, divorce, jail, poverty, ugly, cancer, kill, rotten, vomit, agony, prison
